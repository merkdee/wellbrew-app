Project Outline
Overview
My project will be an inventory management system that will allow users to manage their inventory. Users will be able to create an account, log in, create, edit, and remove item_categories, create, edit, and remove items/products. They will be able to review all expenses, expenses by month, and expenses by category.

I decided to make this project because I got my start in IT as a hardware technician. One of the hardest things to manage was hardware inventory despite having a management system for incidents. While I have use many iventory system since then, I wanted to create one where I could combine asset management and basic stock. This application can be beneifical for techinicians that manage assets and stock, allowing the vendor information to be stored with the item.

What I'll Have to Learn
I am newish to JPA/Hiberate. I understand Springboot HTTP Requests, HTTP Responses, and serving up templates. I don't know how to create a list in Java to save or return from DB. I will have to do some research on this along with db relationship and what makes sense for a project of this size. I also will have to dive deeper into Thymeleaf to insure im using the correct syntax when returning lists.
